# Config Flow Redesign - Operator-First Approach

## Overview

Reorganized the configuration flow to ask for the operator **first**, then use the operator name as the default device name. This creates a more logical flow and better default names.

---

## New Flow Order

### Before (Old Flow)
```
1. Device Name → "Entur Avvik" (generic)
2. Select Operator → Skyss
3. Select Lines → 925, 900
Result: Device named "Entur Avvik"
```

### After (New Flow)
```
1. Select Operator → Skyss
2. Device Name → "Skyss" (auto-filled from operator)
3. Select Lines → 925, 900
Result: Device named "Skyss" (descriptive!)
```

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Better Default Names**
- Old: Generic "Entur Avvik" for all devices
- New: Specific "Skyss", "Ruter", "AtB" etc.
- Users can identify devices at a glance

### 2. **More Logical Flow**
- Ask "what" (operator) before "how to name it" (device name)
- Context helps users understand what they're naming
- Natural progression: What → Name → Details

### 3. **Automatic Context**
- Device name field shows: "Choose a name for... from **Skyss**"
- User sees which operator they're configuring
- Less confusion, better UX

### 4. **Still Customizable**
- Default is operator name
- User can change to anything they want
- "Skyss Bergen", "Skyss Night Lines", etc.

## User Experience Examples

### Example 1: Skyss User (Default Name)
```
Step 1: Select Operator
→ Chooses "Skyss (SKY)"

Step 2: Name Your Device
→ Field shows: "Skyss" (auto-filled)
→ Description: "...from Skyss"
→ User presses Next (keeps default)

Step 3: Select Lines
→ Chooses lines 925, 900

Result: Device named "Skyss" with 2 sensors
```

### Example 2: Ruter User (Custom Name)
```
Step 1: Select Operator
→ Chooses "Ruter (RUT)"

Step 2: Name Your Device
→ Field shows: "Ruter" (auto-filled)
→ User changes to: "Ruter Oslo City"

Step 3: Select Lines
→ Chooses lines 1, 2, 3

Result: Device named "Ruter Oslo City" with 3 sensors
```

### Example 3: Multiple Skyss Devices
```
First Device:
- Operator: Skyss → Name: "Skyss Bergen" → Lines: City routes

Second Device:
- Operator: Skyss → Name: "Skyss Express" → Lines: Express routes

Result: Two distinct Skyss devices with clear names
```

## Summary

This redesign creates a much more intuitive setup flow by:
1. ✅ Asking for context (operator) first
2. ✅ Using that context for intelligent defaults
3. ✅ Creating descriptive device names automatically
4. ✅ Still allowing full customization
5. ✅ Maintaining backward compatibility

The result is a better user experience with minimal code changes and no breaking changes for existing users.
