# Entur Situation Exchange API - Progress Field Validation

## Date: 2025-10-16

## API Specification Analysis

According to the official Norwegian SIRI Profile documentation (https://enturas.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUBLIC/pages/637370605/SIRI-SX):

### Progress Field Specification

The `Progress` field in PtSituationElement has type `WorkflowStatusEnumeration` with **only 2 possible values**:

1. **`open`** - The situation is currently active
2. **`closed`** - The situation is over and traffic has returned to normal

From the spec:
> "Status of a situation message. Possible values: open, closed (the situation is over and traffic has returned to normal). Please note that when Progress is set to 'closed' the message is considered expired and should not be presented to the public."

## Our Implementation Status: ✅ CORRECT

### What We Do Right:

1. **Treating closed situations as expired** (api.py line 127-128):
   ```python
   if progress_lower == "closed":
       status = STATUS_EXPIRED
   ```
   This keeps recently resolved situations visible with an "expired" status until the API stops returning them.

2. **Case-insensitive comparison** (api.py line 102):
   ```python
   progress_lower = progress.lower()
   ```
   This handles API inconsistencies where sometimes "OPEN" or "Open" or "open" is returned.

3. **Enhanced status determination**:
   We go beyond the API's simple `open`/`closed` by calculating our own status:
   - `STATUS_PLANNED` - ValidityPeriod hasn't started yet
   - `STATUS_OPEN` - Currently active within validity period
   - `STATUS_EXPIRED` - Either Progress=closed OR past the EndTime of validity period
   
   This is calculated from both the Progress field AND ValidityPeriod timestamps.

### Why Our Approach is Better:

The API only tells us:
- `Progress=open` → situation exists and hasn't been formally closed
- `Progress=closed` → situation has been resolved

But we enhance this by checking the actual validity times AND the Progress field:
```python
# If Progress is closed, mark as expired (resolved but still returned by API)
if progress_lower == "closed":
    status = STATUS_EXPIRED
elif now_timestamp < start_timestamp:
    status = STATUS_PLANNED
elif end_time:
    end_timestamp = datetime.fromisoformat(end_time).timestamp()
    if now_timestamp > end_timestamp:
        status = STATUS_EXPIRED
    else:
        status = STATUS_OPEN
```

This gives users much more useful information:
- **Planned** situations (planned disruptions that haven't started)
- **Open** situations (currently happening now)
- **Expired** situations (either formally closed OR past their end time)

**Key benefit**: Users can see recently resolved situations for context. They remain visible with "expired" status until the API stops returning them (typically a few hours after closure).

## Real-World API Examples

From the live API response (2025-10-16):

1. **Open situations**:
   ```xml
   <Progress>open</Progress>
   <ValidityPeriod>
       <StartTime>2025-10-16T07:59:00+02:00</StartTime>
       <EndTime>2025-10-16T11:59:00+02:00</EndTime>
   </ValidityPeriod>
   ```

2. **Closed situations**:
   ```xml
   <Progress>closed</Progress>
   <ValidityPeriod>
       <StartTime>2025-10-16T05:13:00+02:00</StartTime>
       <EndTime>2025-10-16T14:34:21.24986279+02:00</EndTime>
   </ValidityPeriod>
   ```

## Conclusion

✅ **Our implementation is correct and follows the API specification**
✅ **We treat closed situations as expired (visible for context)**
✅ **We add value by providing granular status based on validity times**
✅ **We handle case-insensitivity for robustness**

**Status Assignment Logic:**
- `Progress=closed` → Always `STATUS_EXPIRED` (resolved)
- `Progress=open` + before StartTime → `STATUS_PLANNED` (planned)
- `Progress=open` + between StartTime and EndTime → `STATUS_OPEN` (active now)
- `Progress=open` + after EndTime → `STATUS_EXPIRED` (ended but not yet marked closed)
- `Progress=open` + no EndTime → `STATUS_OPEN` (ongoing with unknown end)

This implementation provides enhanced functionality for Home Assistant users by keeping recently resolved situations visible until the API naturally stops returning them.
